All of the text in your write-up should be *in your own words*. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the [http://www.w3schools.com/](http://www.w3schools.com/) website for instructions. To edit the HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.

The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both mesh images as well as written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!

If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking page.

Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. Test your website on the instructional machines early!

- Your main report page should be called index.html.
- Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!
- Use only *relative* paths to files, such as `"./images/image.jpg"`
Do *NOT* use absolute paths, such as `"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"`
- Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. `.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG`
- Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: [http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html)
- And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!

Here is an example of how to include a simple formula:

    a^2 + b^2 = c^2

or, alternatively, you can include an SVG image of a LaTex formula.
